# Multi-Modal Resting-State Dataset

*MultiModalRest* is an ongoing effort to collect and format multi-modal resting-state brain data, including EEG, MEG, fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioral. The data is collected from multiple sources and is available in identical formats to facilitate multi-modal analysis.
