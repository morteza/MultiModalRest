# ULHPC Graviton3E Compilers

The default compiler on the ULHPC Graviton3E cluster is an optimized GCC v12.2.0. By default, it can be loaded by running the `module load gcc` command. However, in this tutorial, we will use the Spack package manager to load the GCC compiler and use it to compile packages.

Spack compiler configuration is 

```bash
module load gcc/12.2.0
```

You can also modify Spack's `compilers.yaml` file:

```bash
spack compiler add
```

and then select the GCC compiler. You can also use the following command to set the GCC compiler as the default compiler:

```bash
spack compiler find
```
