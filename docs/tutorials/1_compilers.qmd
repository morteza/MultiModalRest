# ULHPC Graviton3E Compilers

The default compiler on the ULHPC Graviton3E cluster is an optimized GCC v12.2.0. By default, it can be loaded by running the `module load compiler/GCC/12.2.0` command. However, here, we will use the Spack package manager to load the GCC compiler and use it to build the packages.

You can add a new compiler by modifying Spack's `compilers.yaml` file (usually in the `~/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml` path).


```yaml
compilers:
- compiler:
    spec: gcc@=12.2.0
    paths:
      cc: /shared/apps/easybuild/software/GCCcore/12.2.0/bin/gcc
      cxx: /shared/apps/easybuild/software/GCCcore/12.2.0/bin/g++
      f77: /shared/apps/easybuild/software/GCCcore/12.2.0/bin/gfortran
      fc: /shared/apps/easybuild/software/GCCcore/12.2.0/bin/gfortran
    flags: {}
    operating_system: amzn2
    target: aarch64
    modules: [ "compiler/GCC/12.2.0" ]
    environment: {}
    extra_rpaths: []
```

Then you can verify that the compiler is correctly loaded:

```bash
spack compiler list
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
==> Available compilers
-- gcc amzn2-aarch64 --------------------------------------------
gcc@7.3.1  gcc@12.2.0
```
