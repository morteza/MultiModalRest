  This tutorial shows how to minimally preprocess resting-state fMRI on Graviton3E clusters.

Most preprocesing tools for fMRI scans are developed for the x86 architecture and the most reproducible way to run a preprocessing pipeline is to use containers. However, pipelines such as fMRIPrep rely on tools that do not support Graviton3E aarch64 architecture yet. Here, we instead use a custom but fast pipeline to minimally pre-process resting-state fMRI images on aarch64 architecture using only available Python and Spack packages on aarch64 architecture.

It requires ANTsPyX, which can be installed using spack on AWS/ULHPC cluster:

```bash
spack install antspyx
spack load antspyx
```

## What does "minimally pre-process" mean here?

Preprocessing steps include:

- register_to_t1w
- clean_signal
- register_to_template


## Loading images

- T1w, T2

## Brain extraction

- [ ] ANTS
- [ ] DeepLearning-based

## Normalization

- ANTS

## Smoothing

## Denoising and filtering

## Registering to a reference coordinate space

## fMRI
